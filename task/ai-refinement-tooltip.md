# Task: Add AI Refinement Tooltip

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Original Requirements
Add a tooltip when user hovers over AI润色.

When user hovers over AI润色, it displays a tooltip: 保持原句风格，更加清晰易懂。

Make the tooltip style consistent with the app UI.

## Final Implementation

### Features
- **Tooltip always visible:** Tooltip text is never cut off, regardless of screen position.
- **Single-line display:** Tooltip text stays on one line and expands as needed.
- **Light, consistent style:** Uses a light background (`bg-gray-100`), subtle border and shadow, and dark text, matching the app's button and modal styles.
- **No overflow:** Tooltip is left-aligned with a small margin, so it never overflows the viewport.
- **Arrow styling:** Arrow matches the tooltip background and border for a polished look.
- **User experience:** Cursor changes to help, smooth fade-in animation, and pointer-events are disabled for non-intrusive UX.

### Technical Solution
- Tooltip is implemented in `src/pages/AppPage.tsx`.
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for all styling and positioning.
- Tooltip container uses `absolute bottom-full left-0 ml-2 min-w-max` to ensure it always fits the content and never overflows the left edge.
- Removed all width restrictions and wrapping constraints, so the tooltip grows as needed.
- Arrow is positioned with `left-6` for a natural look under the tooltip.

### Result
The tooltip for "AI润色" now appears on hover, is always fully visible, never cut off, and visually matches the rest of the app UI. The implementation is robust for all screen positions and text lengths.
