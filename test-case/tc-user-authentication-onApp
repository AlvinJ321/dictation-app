# User Authentication Error Handling Test Cases

## OTP Request Step

### Scenario 1: Invalid Phone Number
- **Precondition:** User is on the login screen.
- **Action:** User enters a phone number with an incorrect format (e.g., "123", "abcdefg", "123456789012345").
- **Expected Result:** An inline error message appears below the phone number field, stating "Invalid phone number format." The "Send OTP" button may be disabled until a valid format is entered.

### Scenario 2: Network Error on OTP Request
- **Precondition:** User has entered a valid phone number.
- **Action:** User clicks the "Send OTP" button, but the application has no internet connectivity.
- **Expected Result:** A global error notification (e.g., a toast or alert) appears, with a message like "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."

### Scenario 3: Server Error on OTP Request
- **Precondition:** User has entered a valid phone number.
- **Action:** User clicks the "Send OTP" button, and the backend server returns a 5xx error.
- **Expected Result:** A global error notification appears, with a message like "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again later."

### Scenario 4: Rate Limiting
- **Precondition:** User has successfully requested an OTP for a phone number.
- **Action:** User attempts to request another OTP for the same number before the cooldown period (e.g., 60 seconds) has elapsed.
- **Expected Result:** The "Send OTP" button is in a disabled state, showing a countdown (e.g., "47s"). Clicking it has no effect.

### Scenario 5: Unregistered Phone Number
- **Precondition:** User is on the login screen.
- **Action:** User enters a valid but unregistered phone number and clicks "Send OTP".
- **Expected Result:** An inline error message appears below the phone number field, stating "This phone number is not registered."
