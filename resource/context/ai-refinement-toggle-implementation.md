## Task Summary: AI Refinement Toggle

This document outlines the implementation of the "AI Refinement" toggle feature, detailing the key challenges encountered and the solutions applied.

### 1. Feature Goal

The primary goal was to introduce a toggle switch in the UI that allows the user to control whether the transcription result is enhanced by a server-side AI.

- **ON State**: The app sends a request to `POST /api/speech?refine=true`.
- **OFF State**: The app sends a standard request to `POST /api/speech`.

### 2. Implementation Details

The implementation spanned both the renderer and main processes of the Electron application.

- **UI (`src/pages/AppPage.tsx`)**: A React component for the toggle switch was added to the main app page. Its state is managed by a `useState` hook.
- **IPC Bridge (`preload.js`, `src/types/electron.d.ts`)**: The communication bridge between the renderer and main process was updated. A new function, `sendRefinementState`, was added to send the toggle's boolean state to the main process.
- **Main Process State (`main.js`)**: A global variable, `isRefinementOn`, was created to store the most recent state received from the UI. An `ipcMain` listener for `set-refinement-state` was set up to update this variable.
- **Audio Processing (`src/main/audio.js`)**: The `MainProcessAudio` class was modified to accept a function that gets the current refinement state. This allowed the `makeSpeechRequest` method to dynamically append the `?refine=true` query parameter to the URL just before sending the request.

### 3. Key Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: State Management Across Processes**

- **Problem**: The toggle's state, originating in a React component in the renderer process, needed to influence an API call made deep within the `MainProcessAudio` class in the main process. Passing the state directly through multiple function calls was impractical and would create tight coupling.
- **Solution**: We implemented a decoupled solution using a "getter" function.
    1.  The `MainProcessAudio` constructor was updated to accept a function, `getRefinementState`.
    2.  In `main.js`, we passed it `() => isRefinementOn`, a function that returns the current value of our global state variable.
    3.  This allowed the `makeSpeechRequest` method in the `audio` module to fetch the latest state at the exact moment it was needed, without having to store the state itself.

**Challenge 2: Tooling Failures**

- **Problem**: The automated file editing tool repeatedly failed to apply changes to `main.js`, blocking progress. The diffing mechanism could not correctly resolve the required modifications.
- **Solution**: After multiple failed attempts, the workaround was to provide the user with the complete, final version of the `main.js` code. The user then manually replaced the file's content, bypassing the faulty tool.

**Challenge 3: UI/UX Polish**

- **Problem**: The initial toggle design did not fully align with the application's aesthetic (the color was too dark) and lacked standard UI feedback (the cursor did not change on hover).
- **Solution**: These were minor but important fixes made directly in `src/pages/AppPage.tsx` using Tailwind CSS utility classes (`bg-blue-500`, `cursor-pointer`) to improve visual consistency and user experience.
