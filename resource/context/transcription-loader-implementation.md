# Summary: Transcription Processing Loader Implementation

This document summarizes the task of implementing and refining the visual loader that appears during the transcription process.

## 1. Initial Goal

The primary objective was to add a subtle visual indicator to the feedback window after a voice recording is complete, signaling to the user that transcription is in progress. This was intended to bridge the gap between recording completion and the display of the transcribed text, improving the user experience.

## 2. Implementation and Debugging Journey

The implementation process involved several challenges and iterations:

### Challenge 1: Loader Not Appearing

Initially, although the loader component (`TranscriptionStatus.tsx`) was created and linked to a `processing` state, it failed to appear on screen. The investigation revealed two independent bugs:

1.  **File-Write Timing Issue:** In `src/main/audio.js`, the `'processing'` status was sent immediately after `audioRecorder.stop()` was called, without waiting for the audio file to be completely written to disk. This caused the subsequent file-reading operation to fail, preventing the status update from ever being correctly processed.
    *   **Solution:** The entire transcription logic was moved into the `fileStream.on('finish', ...)` event handler, guaranteeing that processing only begins after the audio file is ready.

2.  **Premature Window Hiding:** In `main.js`, the global key listener was programmed to hide the feedback window (`feedbackWindow.hide()`) immediately upon the hotkey's "UP" event. This hid the window before it had a chance to receive the `'processing'` status and render the loader.
    *   **Solution:** The `feedbackWindow.hide()` call was removed from the key-up event handler, allowing the feedback component's internal state to control its visibility.

### Challenge 2: Visual Design and Refinement

Once the loader was functional, the focus shifted to its visual appearance to ensure it was subtle and consistent with the existing UI, particularly the audio wave animation.

1.  **Initial Version:** A simple spinning `Hourglass` icon was used as a placeholder. This was deemed too generic and visually jarring.
2.  **Second Version:** A user-provided CSS animation featuring three animated dots was implemented. This was an improvement but was considered too large.
3.  **Third Version:** The size of the three-dot loader was reduced.
4.  **Final Version:** The design was changed again based on new user requirements to a different, more subtle three-dot animation. The final implementation involved adjusting its size and color (`#3B82F6`) to perfectly match the aesthetic of the audio wave.

## 3. Final Implementation

The final solution consists of:

*   **`src/main/audio.js`:** Robust audio processing logic that correctly waits for the file to be saved before proceeding.
*   **`main.js`:** A streamlined key-listener that delegates window visibility control to the UI components.
*   **`src/index.css`:** Custom CSS and `@keyframes` for the final loader animation, with appropriate size and color.
*   **`src/components/TranscriptionStatus.tsx`:** A simple React component that renders the loader.
*   **`src/feedback.tsx`:** State management to conditionally render the loader based on the `'processing'` status received from the main process.
