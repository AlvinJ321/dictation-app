That's an excellent question, as it gets to the core of why we built the backend API the way we did. Your desktop app can access the username and photo by acting as another client and interacting with the same API endpoints your web portal uses.

Here is the step-by-step process for your desktop app:

### Step 1: User Authentication

First, your desktop app must authenticate the user to get an access token. It would follow the same logic as your web app's login flow:

1.  The user enters their phone number into your desktop app.
2.  The app sends a request to the `POST /api/send-verification-code` endpoint.
3.  The user receives a code, enters it into the app.
4.  The app sends the phone number and verification code to the `POST /api/verify` endpoint.
5.  If successful, the server responds with an **`accessToken`** and a `refreshToken`. Your desktop application **must securely store** these tokens (especially the `refreshToken`) for future use.

### Step 2: Fetching User Profile Data

Once the desktop app has a valid `accessToken`, it can fetch the user's profile information.

1.  The app needs to make a `GET` request to your server's `/api/profile` endpoint.
2.  In this request, it **must** include an `Authorization` header, using the `accessToken` it received during login. The format is crucial:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token_here>
    ```

### Step 3: Handling the Server's Response

If the `accessToken` is valid, the server will respond with a JSON object containing the user's data. Based on our latest code, the response will look like this:

```json
{
  "userId": 123,
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890",
  "username": "Alvin",
  "avatarUrl": "https://voco-user-avatars.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/avatars/2-17...png?OSSAccessKeyId=...",
  "avatarKey": "avatars/2-1749...png"
}
```

Hereâ€™s how your desktop app should use this data:

*   **Username:** Simply take the value from the `"username"` field (`"Alvin"`) and display it in your app's UI.
*   **Photo:** Take the full URL from the `"avatarUrl"` field. This is a **temporary, signed URL** that is valid for one hour. Your desktop app should use this URL immediately to download the image data. It can then display that image and cache it locally if needed. **Do not store this URL itself**, as it will expire.

By following this flow, your desktop application can securely authenticate users and retrieve their latest profile information, including their name and avatar, directly from the server.
